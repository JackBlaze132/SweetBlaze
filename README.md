# SweetBlaze
real-time notification client for a candy shop called SweetBlaze, using Django (or Python) for the backend with WebSockets, and Vue + Ionic for the frontend. Notifications must support file uploads (e.g., images or PDFs) and display them dynamically in the UI. The project focuses on functionality, clean code, and simple but effective UX/UI design.
